# conzept-extra

**This repo is not required for running Conzept, only for developers wanting to modify these apps.**

These are a few patched Conzept embedded apps and libraries which require building out-of-tree.

Just “cd” into each directory and follow the build instructions.

Then use the “**npm run conzept-deploy**” within each app directory, to insert the build-artifacts into the Conzept web directory.
